# Product Overview

This repository is a lightweight AI-collaboration template (Claude designs, Codex implements) with a small FastAPI sample used to demonstrate the workflow.

## Core Capabilities

- Provide a minimal Time API with `/jst` and `/utc` JSON endpoints.
- Demonstrate FastAPI + Pydantic patterns in a compact, single-file service.
- Offer a simple Python project scaffold for quick iteration and experiments.
- Serve as a working example for the Claude + Codex development flow.

## Target Use Cases

- Quick demos or tests of API endpoint patterns.
- A sandbox repo for AI-assisted design/implementation workflows.
- Reference for building small, self-contained FastAPI samples.

## Value Proposition

A tiny, low-ceremony codebase that prioritizes clarity and repeatable AI collaboration over feature breadth.
